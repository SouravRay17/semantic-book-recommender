# Semantic Book Recommender

This is a **Semantic Book Recommendation System** that uses **LangChain**, **HuggingFace embeddings**, and **ChromaDB** to provide book recommendations based on user queries. The system allows filtering by category and emotional tone and is integrated with a **Gradio** dashboard for an interactive UI.

## Features
- **Semantic Search**: Uses embeddings to find books similar to a user's query.
- **Emotion-Based Filtering**: Sort recommendations based on emotions like joy, anger, sadness, etc.
- **Category Selection**: Filter books by specific genres/categories.
- **Interactive UI**: Powered by **Gradio**.
